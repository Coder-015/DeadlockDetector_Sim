# DeadlockDetector_Sim
This project presents an interactive educational simulator for understanding deadlocks in operating systems. Unlike traditional theoretical approaches, our simulator provides a visual, hands-on learning experience that demonstrates deadlock detection, prevention, and resolution through an intuitive graphical interface. The system implements real-time algorithm visualization, making complex OS concepts accessible and engaging for students.

# Technology Stack

We built the simulator using modern web technologies:
    Frontend: HTML5 + CSS3 + JavaScript
    Visualization: Canvas API + CSS Animations
    Algorithms: Graph Theory Implementation
    UI/UX: Responsive Design Principles

# Planned Features
  Multi-user collaboration for group learning
  Performance analytics for student assessment
  Gamification elements (points, levels, challenges)
  Curriculum integration with lesson plans

# Technical Improvements
  Real-time collaboration features
  Mobile app development
  Scenario library expansion
  API for educators to create custom content

# Research Directions
  Study long-term knowledge retention
  Compare with traditional teaching methods
  Expand to other OS concepts (scheduling, memory management)
  Develop AI-powered tutoring features

# “This simulator doesn't just teach deadlocks - it brings them to life, making students not just understand, but experience one of operating systems' most fascinating phenomena.”
